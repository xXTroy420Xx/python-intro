Sure, I'd be happy to explain binary system to you as if you're 8!
So, imagine you have two special numbers: 0 and 1. These numbers are very important because we use them to talk to computers!
Just like how you can count from 0 to 9 with your fingers, computers can count with only 0 and 1. Instead of fingers, computers use tiny switches called "bits" that can be either on (1) or off (0).
When we use binary system, we write numbers using only these two special numbers, 0 and 1. So, if we want to write the number "2" in binary, we write "10" because it's like saying "1 lot of 2, and 0 lots of 1". If we want to write the number "5" in binary, we write "101" because it's like saying "1 lot of 4, 0 lots of 2, and 1 lot of 1".
Computers are really good at understanding binary because they're designed to work with it. So, when we type a letter on the keyboard, the computer turns it into a special combination of 0's and 1's that it can understand and use to do all sorts of things like display pictures, play music, or even talk to other computers!
